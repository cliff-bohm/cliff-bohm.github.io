<p align="justify"> Markov Brains have proven to be a powerful tool for studying 
theoretical evolution and for modeling biological systems. In this workshop you will
be introduced to Markov Brains and MABE.</p>
<p align="justify">MABE is an evolution system used to generate and evolve
populations of digital organisms. Organisims contain genomes which define brains,
which in turn control the actions of the organisms. Once created, organisms are placed into a digital
world. Worlds can be designed to generate scores which can be used to determine
which organisms will sire the next generation or worlds can be designed as open ended
systems with implicet mating and death. In either case, both asexual and sexual reproduction are
supported, and various forms of mutation and crossover can be applied during reporduction.
MABE supports multi chromosome ploidy genomes.</p>
<p align="justify">While MABE was originally developed to study Markov Network Brains, one of the
design philosophies was to make it entirely modular. MABE therefore allows for other types
of genomes, brains, organisms, and worlds; making it an ideal system to
compare different evolving computational systems.</p>
